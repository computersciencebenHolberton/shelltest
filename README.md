# We will be building a simple shell that includes the basic functionality of a traditional Unix command line user 
 
 That includes functions access, execve, exit, fork, free, fstat, getline, malloc, perror, signal, stat, wait, write. 
 
 - All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
 - Using gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o hsh to compile

* It need to be able to read information.
* It need to be able to interpret the information given.
* It needs to be able to execute the command. 
* It needs to be able to free up used memory and shut down. 

## How can we write a simple shell program to be able to do all the steps in order
